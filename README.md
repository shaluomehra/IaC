**In simple terms**: Imagine you're building a Lego castle. Instead of manually putting each block in place, you have a set of instructions. You follow the steps in the instructions to assemble the castle quickly and accurately

**In tech terms**: IaC is like having a set of instructions, but for setting up and managing computer systems and networks. Instead of doing everything manually, you use code (like a script or a recipe) to tell computers what to do. This makes it faster, less error-prone, and easier to manage.

## What is Configuration Management

**In simple terms**: Think of a chef in a restaurant. They have a recipe book that tells them how to prepare different dishes. If they need to change the recipe or make more of a dish, they can follow the steps in the recipe.

**In tech terms**: Configuration management is like having a recipe book for setting up and maintaining computer systems. It helps ensure that all the software, settings, and components on a computer are consistent and working correctly. If there are changes or updates needed, the configuration management tool handles it

## What is Orchestration

**In simple terms**: Picture a conductor leading an orchestra. They coordinate all the musicians to play their instruments at the right time and in harmony.

**In tech terms**: Orchestration is like being the conductor for a bunch of computers. It coordinates different tasks, like starting or stopping applications, managing resources, and making sure everything works together smoothly. This is especially important in large, complex systems.
